# Solana Wallet Extension

This is a Solana wallet browser extension built using Vite and React. The extension allows users to interact with the Solana blockchain directly from their browser.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (for building the project)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (for dependency management)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solana-wallet-extension.git
   cd solana-wallet-extension
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   Using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   Or using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Build the Extension

To build the extension, run the following command:

```bash
yarn build
```

Or with npm:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder containing all the necessary files for your extension.

### Load the Extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer Mode** by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
3. Click the **Load unpacked** button.
4. Select the `dist` folder generated by the build process.

Your Solana wallet extension should now be loaded and ready to use!

### Development

If you want to work on the extension and see the changes live, you can run the development server with:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Or with npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then, follow the same steps to load the unpacked extension from the `dist` folder.
